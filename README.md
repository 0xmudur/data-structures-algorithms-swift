## Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measuere of time required to run an algorithms as the input size incereases.

## Big O notation 
Big O notation to represent various magnitudes of time complexity

## Time complexity types
- Constans Time O(1)
- Linear Time O(n)
- Quadric Time O(n^2)
- Logarithmic Time O(logn)
- Quasilinear Time O(nlogn)

## Main Data Structures that the Swift Standart Library
- Array
- Set 
- Dictionary

### Key Points
- Order 
- Random access 
- Array performance 
- Insert Location

Functions such as "insert" for array hava performance characteristics that can be cripple
performance when used hehazzardly. If you finding yourself need to use "insert" frequently
with indices near of the beginning of array, you want to consider a different data
structure such as "linked-list"

Dictionary trades away the ability to maintain the order of it's element for fast
insertions and serching 

Set guarantees uniqueness in a collection of values. Set is optimezed for speed and
abondons the ability retain the order of the elements

Swift collections pacakage constains specialized data structure thaa perform better in
certain scenarios.
